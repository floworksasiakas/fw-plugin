KNOWN BUGS/OTHER NOTES

    - Usernames that will get modified by wordpress "slugging" will cause
      bugs. For example, using white spaces in usernames causes wordpress
      to replace them with "-". This has not been taken into account.
    - Admin side task creation doesn't save the information about
      which project the task belongs to, even though the interface for it
      exists.
    - When creating a task for a certain project, one can set the task to
      belong to a person not in the project.
    - Creating 2 project pages with identical names can cause bugs (not tested).
    - When commenting on a task, user cannot comment multiple "command words"
      in a one comment. For example, !assign <name> and #done cannot be used
      simultaneously.
